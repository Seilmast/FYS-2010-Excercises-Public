We have an image with 255 values, which we can represent by a number of bits. 
To display every discrete instance of light, we can choose 8-bits as this gives us 256 unique values to work with. 
Including "no light", we now have a 1:1 ratio of discrete bit-values and illumination. 
If we now reduce the bits from 8 to 7, we only have 2^7=128 unique values which must strech over 256 values of illumination. 
This means that two values of illumination must share the same digitized representation. 
Reducing the bit from 8 to 6, we now have 2⁶=64 unique values. This means 4 values of intensity must share the same digital representation.
From 8 to 5 bits we get 2⁵ = 32 unique values. This means 8 values of intensity must share the same digital representation
From 8 to 4 bits we get 2⁴ = 16 unique values. This means 16 values of intensity must share the same digital representation

We can represent this as a table 

8-bit: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
7-bit: 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5  5  6  6  7  7  8  8  9  9 10 10 
6-bit: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3  3  3  3  4  4  4  4  5  5  5  5
5-bit: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  3  3  3
4-bit: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2 

Given that humans can detect abrubt changes between shades which differs with eight or more in intensity, we expect contouring to occur 
at 5 bits or lower. At 5-bits, we have k= 2⁵ = 32
